# Learn Git
https://github.com/thelehhman/learn-git

## Introduction
- Forget Initial Commit for now
- There are two branches - **master** and **working**
- The commit story is as follows:
	* First commit adds first.txt
	* Second Commit adds second.txt
	* Third Commit fixes typo in first file
	* Fourth Commit changes the README.md file
	
## Tasks
- Fork this repo to your private github repo
- Clone the repository to your system
- Delete the third file, and commit the changes
- The second commit message is wrong. It should be changed to "Added Second File" 
- The third commit fixes a typo in the first file. To have a cleaner repo, merge these 2 commits into one.
- Merge working with master
- Push it to github at https://github.com/{your_username}/learn-git
- Make a PR request to this repo in the master branch

## Rules
- You are free to use any Internet websites for this
- This is a binary question, you will be alloted 5 Marks for correctness, else you'll be given 1.
- Students who don't attend the quiz will be awarded no marks
